# IMPISC - miscellaneous flight code for IMPISH piggyback
Here are scripts and other helper programs for the IMPISH piggyback.
The main detector code is at [umn-detector-code](https://github.com/umn-impish/umn-detector-code/tree/main),
but we need some supporting code to talk to it and use it effectively.
